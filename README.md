# Polkadot and Kusama Common Logs
## Here are some Polkadot, Kusama and Westend logs and what they mean. ##
Few questions come to mind when troubleshooting issue

- Are you running the Latest version of code?
- 
-

## You can review some of the reported Bugs here https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues

## To see your logs run this 
```
sudo journalctl -u polkadot.service -n 1000
```
You can modify the ```1000``` to display fewer or more logs
## Common Log (Life is good)

## Life is good, Block #8302347 has been imported
```
✨ Imported #8302347 (0x296d…fb2f)
```
## You have 49 peers (in and out connections), the current block is #8302347, and your node finalized block #8302345 Downloading 2.7MiB/s and Uploading ⬆ 1.9MiB/s
```
💤 Idle (49 peers), best: #8302347 (0x296d…fb2f), finalized #8302345 (0x22e3…877e), ⬇ 2.7MiB/s ⬆ 1.9MiB/s
```
- By default you should have around 50 peers, you can modify it to reduce or increase the number
- Increasing number of peer will cause bigger bandwidth utilization but there is no proof that it will increase era poins

## Your node just discovered a new peer 
```
🔍 Discovered new external address for our node: 
/ip4/100.107.63.128/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWDz7FcPsbr8v5pvPngz4GtYWVrzYBsn3CLb5NVEHPBfQa
```
## Reorgs are fine and normal
```
♻️  Reorg on #8302389,0x2813…6e7d to #8302389,0x012f…a2fd, common ancestor #8302388,0x723f…b858
```
## 🚀🚀This is what you want to see, your node has authored a block🚀🚀
```
🙌 Starting consensus session on top of parent 0xcc0d40157526a1447fde0249d054c44e797b5ee8fd3c46b0ef06cacbdcd2b9b1
🎁 Prepared block for proposing at 8302664 [hash: 0x5de0dd21af6f60efe7fd90e750c323868c08573cb432aa741c684200b4864bfc; 
parent_hash: 0xcc0d…b9b1; extrinsics (2): [0x8e13…4d35, 0xc9e6…2eb1]]
```
## Node is syncing, target, best and finalized blocks are displayed 
```
⚙️  Syncing  0.3 bps, target=#8303186 (30 peers), best: #8303176 (0xca88…809f), 
finalized #8303175 (0x04ed…4512), ⬇ 49.2kiB/s ⬆ 410.8kiB/s
```
## You will not going to see this too often, increas number of Validators in the Active set
```
💸 new validator set of size 350 has been elected via ElectionCompute::Unsigned for era 905
```
## New epoch 14189 will start in block 0x9c17…9142 
```
👶 New epoch 14189 launching at block 0x9c17…9142 (block slot 271007079 >= start slot 271007079).
```
## New epoch starts in slot 271007679
```
👶 Next epoch starts at slot 271007679
```
## Are you running the latest version of the code? Are you sure?
```
💔 Error importing block 0xbe4cdf08f705a8095a0d860ae6dfd17ef0e4766508c40d5d1a5efd4cbf6ba23d: Err(Other(ClientImport
("Invalid operation in the pending changes tree: Tried to import or finalize node that is an ancestor of a
previously finalized node")))
```
You will see this if your node is running an incorrect version.
